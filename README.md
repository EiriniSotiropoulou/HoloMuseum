# HoloMuseum
My student thesis. AR educational app for museums using MS Hololens, Unity &amp; C#
Developped an Augmented Reality (AR) application for Patras Archealogical Museum, using Unity and C sharp. The application's goal was to educate the user about Ancient Greece. My job was to create the UI in the form of Holograms, as well as to integrate directional arrows to help the user navigate the museum.
